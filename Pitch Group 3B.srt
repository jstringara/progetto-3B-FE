1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,280
Climate change is undoubtedly the 21st century
biggest challenge and we must solve it together.

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,360
Of course, climate inaction is now the most
economically convenient thing to do but we,

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,360
as a species, will have to foot
the bill in the near future.

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:22,520
Our study reveals some key insights into how the
Green Transition could be made financially viable.

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,240
Carlo, what's up? What are you doing out so early?

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,000
Jacopo, I'm having my morning run!

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,600
I saw the sun was out and took the opportunity.
We have had some crazy weather lately.

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,360
Yeah, that's climate change kicking in!
You know, I've actually been reading

9
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,520
a few papers about the European
Union Emissions Trading Scheme.

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,320
Oh, really? What is it?

11
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,200
It's a way for polluters to exchange their Carbon
Allowances, usually in the form of futures.

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,600
But I know it is not a very liquid
and efficient market, isn't it?

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,280
Yeah, it was created back in 2005 and it was
very volatile but we are on Phase IV now and

14
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,960
there have been a lot of reforms,
although it 's still very costly

15
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,360
for polluters to trade.
That's called the C-spread.

16
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,480
Oh, come on, let's meet and work on it!
Yeah!

17
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:05,519
The C-spread, is defined as the following formula.
And we use as F(t,t) the Front December futures,

18
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,320
the futures with expiry in
December of the same year,

19
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,560
which we have found to be the most liquid
and as S(t) we use the Daily Futures.

20
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,440
The C-spread represents the
cost-of-carry, measuring the

21
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,320
difference between the price of Futures
on Carbon Allowances and their spot price.

22
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:26,000
To compute it, we used a rollover rule
in order to avoid irregularities and

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,240
have a unique time-series using
as switch date 15th November.

24
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:35,480
We also considered Europe's top 10 polluters
and computed the Z-spreads of their bonds,

25
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,240
that is the parallel shift to apply to the
zero-rates in order to match their prices.

26
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,760
We aggregated them and computed a single
time-series, which we called the Z-index.

27
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,840
We plotted the C-spread, Z-index and
Risk-Free Rate in a single image.

28
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,360
As we can see the Z-index and the
C-spread display a long run relationship.

29
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:59,160
We perform an ADF-GLS test and confirm that the
three time series are integrated of order 1.

30
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:04,280
We also discover their cointegration
relationship by using the Johansen procedure.

31
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,640
Since the three time-series are not stationary,

32
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,840
we took the time-series of their first-differences
and implemented this error correction model.

33
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,680
As control variables we took three
market indexes and the volatility

34
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,000
of the spot log-returns, which
is estimated with a GARCH model.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,280
As a result, we obtain that the
C-spread is a mean-reverting

36
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,520
process and the Z-index is its main
driver and this is very relevant.

37
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,560
We implemented both Quantile and Linear Regression

38
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,240
because not all hypotheses of the
Linear Regression were satisfied.

39
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,920
And now for the missing
piece of the C-spread puzzle.

40
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:48,240
For the companies involved there is an
alternative method of financing: a Synthetic Repo.

41
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:53,920
That is a contract replicating the cashflows of
a traditional repo but using a Carbon Future.

42
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,520
By analyzing the strategy we found that the payer

43
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:01,400
would be financing itself at the
Risk-Free Rate plus the C-spread.

44
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,920
Finally, including Carbon Allowances into the
list of eligible collateral for Eurosystem

45
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,520
credit operations could help address the
inefficieny of having a positive C-spread.

46
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,960
In finance we are used to thinking
in terms of Profits and Losses,

47
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,920
but mankind's true profit
would be a greener planet.
